## 📌 Executive Summary
This project delivers a quantitative financial health assessment of **Tesla Inc.** for the fiscal year 2024. By applying the **Altman Z-Score** framework, I developed a dynamic Python-based model to evaluate insolvency risk with high precision, moving beyond traditional manual entry methods.

## 📊 The Analytical Framework
The Altman Z-Score serves as a multivariate predictive model, assessing corporate stability through five critical financial pillars:

* **$X_1$ (Liquidity Index):** Working Capital / Total Assets
* **$X_2$ (Cumulative Profitability):** Retained Earnings / Total Assets
* **$X_3$ (Operating Efficiency):** EBIT / Total Assets
* **$X_4$ (Market Solvency):** Market Cap / Total Liabilities
* **$X_5$ (Asset Turnover):** Sales / Total Assets

## 🚀 Analytical Capabilities
* **Automated Quantitative Logic:** Real-time calculation of risk metrics using Python.
* **Risk Categorization:** Systematic classification of results into **Safe**, **Grey**, or **Distress** zones.
* **Strategic Benchmarking:** Practical application using Tesla’s 2024 financial data.

## 🛠️ Methodological Infrastructure
* **Analytical Engine:** Python 3.x
* **Visualization:** Power BI & Plotly
* **Domain:** Financial Analysis & Risk Management
