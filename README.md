# 📉 Tesla Inc. Strategic Solvency Assessment (Altman Z-Score Model)

## 📌 Executive Summary
This project delivers a quantitative financial health assessment of **Tesla Inc.** for the fiscal year 2024. By applying the **Altman Z-Score** framework, I moved beyond static reporting to develop a dynamic Python-based model that evaluates insolvency risk with high precision, providing deeper insights than traditional spreadsheet manual entries.

## 📊 The Analytical Framework
The Altman Z-Score serves as a multivariate predictive model, assessing corporate stability through five critical financial pillars:

* **$X_1$ (Liquidity Index):** Working Capital / Total Assets – *Measures short-term operational resilience.*
* **$X_2$ (Cumulative Profitability):** Retained Earnings / Total Assets – *Assesses historical reinvestment strength.*
* **$X_3$ (Operating Efficiency):** EBIT / Total Assets – *Measures productivity of the entity’s asset base.*
* **$X_4$ (Market Solvency):** Market Cap / Total Liabilities – *Evaluates equity cushion against total debt.*
* **$X_5$ (Asset Turnover):** Sales / Total Assets – *Determines revenue generation efficiency.*
